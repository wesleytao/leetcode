# leetcode
A fierce, cruel battleground for noob coders.
# Rule
Create a new branch with format {FirstnameLastName} i.e. WesleyTao  

Push to your own branch only  

Every day, you need to complete 5 easy || 2 medium || 1 hard problem(s) from leetcode. You can pick whatever problems you want.

To check-in for each day, you need to commit the following things:

Updated README.md specifying the date and links to the problems finished within the day

A folder with date YYYY-MM-DD as name and answer to each question

Participants should provide code reviews for other participants. Comment on others' commit if you find any smelling code and humiliate the author as you want.

Participants who fail to upload before 11:59 p.m. local time will be publicly humiliated on the master branch.


# Penalty
The person who failed to submit has to do push-ups for the penalty. One easy problem= 10 push up
